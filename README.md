JAVASCRIPT AND DOM- MANIPULATION:
This repo takes data stored in a Javascript file and displays filtered data from that file on an HTML page.

Concepts include:

1 HTML
2 CSS
3 Javascript

Why is this important?
This workshop is important because:

When you want to make changes happen on the page, you need to manipulate the DOM. jQuery as a tool is designed to simplify communication with the DOM.

What are the objectives?
After this workshop, developers will be able to:

describe and draw the document object model (DOM) of a simple HTML document.
use the elements tab to view an manipulate the DOM and styling.
explain the relationship between JavaScript and jQuery and the benefits of using jQuery for DOM manipulation
select elements from the page using CSS Selectors and use jQuery to dynamically change the DOM

DOM
The Document Object Model or DOM is a key concept to understanding what a browser does with your HTML. The browser looks at your HTML and creates a "tree", much like a family tree of siblings, parents, and children.
